//! libpathrs::opath implements an emulated version of openat2(RESOLVE_IN_ROOT).
//! The primary method by which this is done is through shameless abuse of
//! procfs and O_PATH magic-links. The basic idea is that we need to perform all
//! of the path resolution steps (walking down the set of components, handling
//! the effect of symlinks on the resolution, etc).
//!
//! In order to do this safely we need to verify after the walk is done whether
//! the path of the final file descriptor is what we expected (most importantly,
//! is it inside the root which we started the walk with?). This check is done
//! through readlink(/proc/self/fd/$n), which is a magic kernel interface which
//! gives you the kernel's view of the path -- and in cases where the kernel is
//! unsure or otherwise unhappy you get "/".
//!
//! If the check fails, we assume we are being attacked and return an error (and
//! the caller can decide to re-try if they want). The kernel implementation
//! will fail in fewer cases because it has access to in-kernel locks and other
//! measures, but the final check through procfs should block all attack
//! attempts.
