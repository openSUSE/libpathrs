/// A wrapper around a handle to `/proc` that is designed to be safe against

/// Unlike most regular filesystems, `/proc` serves several important purposes
/// for system administration programs:
///
///  1. As a mechanism for doing certain filesystem operations through
///     `/proc/self/fd/...` (and other similar magic-links) that cannot be done
///     by other means.
///  2. As a source of true information about processes and the general system.
///  3. As an administrative tool for managing other processes (such as setting
///     LSM labels).
///
/// libpathrs uses `/proc` internally for the first purpose and many libpathrs
/// users use `/proc` for all three. As such, it is not sufficient that
/// operations on `/proc` paths do not escape the `/proc` filesystem -- it is
/// absolutely critical that operations through `/proc` operate on the path that
/// the caller expected.
///
/// This might seem like an esoteric concern, but there have been several
/// security vulnerabilities where a maliciously configured `/proc` could be
/// used to trick administrative processes into doing unexpected operations (for
/// example, [CVE-2019-16884][] and [CVE-2019-19921][]). See [this
/// video][lca2020] for a longer explanation of the many other issues that
/// `/proc`-based checking is needed to protect against and [this other
/// video][lpc2022] for some other procfs challenges libpathrs has to contend
/// with.
///
/// NOTE: At the moment, `ProcfsHandle` only supports doing operations within
/// `/proc/self` and `/proc/thread-self`. This is because there are tools like
/// [lxcfs] which intentionally mask parts of `/proc` in order to fix issues
/// like `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/cpuinfo` not being cgroup-aware.
/// `ProcfsHandle` will refuse to open files that have these overmounts, which
/// could lead to application errors that users may not expect. However, no such
/// tool masks paths inside `/proc/$pid` directories because such masking would
/// be expensive (because of FUSE limitations, you would need to emulate every
/// file within `/proc` to do this properly) and would cause application-visible
/// issues (magic-link lookups would not work as they normally do). So we can
/// safely provide handlers for `/proc/self` and `/proc/thread-self` (which are
/// the main things a lot of libpathrs users care about).
